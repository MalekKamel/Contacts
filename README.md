# Contacts

Contacts app represents a real world app example: it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities,
it's a suitable showcase for all the advantages that architecture components bring, 
has all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app.
 
## App Logic

- The app displays the list of userâ€™s contacts that are saved in `Room` local database.
- If there's no data in `Room`, it will be retrieved from contacts `ContentPorvider` and saved locally in `Room`.
- The local contacts are synchronized with `ContentPorvider` in background every 15 minutes using `WorkManager`.
- The local contacts are synchronized every time the user opens the app.

## Modular Architecture
 
<img src="https://github.com/ShabanKamell/Contacts/blob/master/blob/modular-arch-diagram3.png?raw=true" height="600">
  
The app is divided into 3 modules under `common` package. Each package has its own responsibilities.
  
### Core

Core module contains all shared classes that are visible to all modules. 
Here we put all the code that we need to share with any module in the app.

### Data

Data module contains any classes related to the data in the app. 
It contains network, local database, SharedPreferences, model classes, and any data-related classes.

### Presentation

Presentation modules contains all UI classes
 including view models, base activities, base fragments, custom views, and other common views.

 ## Google Architecture Components
 
 The app implements Google architecture components. Visit the [Guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) for the details.

## Unit Tests

You can find tests in `app` and `data' modules.

## README

Each module has its own `README.md` file that documents the module responsibilities.
